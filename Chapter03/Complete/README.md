# Appointments

This is the example application for the book _Mastering Test-Driven Development for React_.

Your source code should go in the `src` directory and your tests in `test`.

# Prerequisities

You'll need to have [Node](http://nodejs.org), including NPM, installed on your machine.

Run `npm install` before attempting any of the instructions below.

You may also wish to run `npm upgrade` to ensure your Node installation is up-to-date.

# Running tests

Use the following command to run all tests.

    npm test

You can also run tests in a single test file:

    npm test test/AppointmentsDayView.test.js

# Building and running the application

Build the application using this command:

    npm run build

Then you can open the app by browsing to `dist/index.html`.
